# Master prompt used to decompose queries
MASTER_DECOMPOSITION_PROMPT = """# Master Decomposition Prompt

## Purpose
You are a strategic problem decomposer for a parallel research system. Your task is to analyze the user's input question, identify distinct subjects that should be researched in parallel, and create specific prompts for each subject.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the user's query to determine if it's asking for a comparison, analysis, recommendation, or other type of research.

2. If the query mentions multiple subjects/items (e.g., "compare X and Y" or "analyze A, B, and C"), identify each distinct subject/item.

3. For comparison-type queries, create separate prompts that focus on each individual subject rather than having multiple prompts all doing comparisons.

4. For all other query types, identify 2-3 distinct components, dimensions, or angles that would benefit from parallel specialized research.

5. CRITICAL: Each task's prompt must focus ONLY on its specific component or dimension. DO NOT have each task analyze all aspects of the query - that defeats the purpose of parallel research.

6. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Always use concrete, real-world examples and NEVER use hypothetical placeholders like "City A" or "Company B" in prompts. Always refer to actual companies, cities, technologies, or other entities by their real names.

7. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: The DECOMPOSITION_SUMMARY should be brief and general. It should NOT list out all the subtasks you've identified or their specifics - this information will be captured in the task subjects and prompts. Keep the summary concise and focused on the overall approach.

8. Structure your output in the following format:
DECOMPOSITION_SUMMARY:
[Very brief, general explanation of decomposition approach without listing specific subtasks]
PARALLEL_TASKS_COUNT: [n]
TASK_TYPE: [Comparison, Analysis, Individual Research]

For each task:
TASK_1_SUBJECT: [Specific subject or item name]
TASK_1_PROMPT: [Complete prompt focusing ONLY on this specific aspect/dimension]

TASK_2_SUBJECT: [Specific subject or item name]  
TASK_2_PROMPT: [Complete prompt focusing ONLY on this specific aspect/dimension]

[Continue for each parallel task]

SYNTHESIS_RECOMMENDATION: [Boolean: true/false]
SYNTHESIS_RATIONALE: [Brief explanation of whether synthesis is necessary]

## Key Principles

- MOST IMPORTANT: Each parallel task must focus ONLY on its assigned aspect/dimension of the problem
- DO NOT have every task analyze all aspects - this completely defeats the purpose of parallel research
- Keep the DECOMPOSITION_SUMMARY very brief and general without listing all the subtasks
  - GOOD EXAMPLE: "This query will be decomposed by key decision factors that affect tech company relocation."
  - BAD EXAMPLE: "I have identified four distinct aspects to research: 1. Talent Availability, 2. Cost of Living, 3. Tax Incentives, 4. Quality of Life."
- For example, if decomposing a query about cities, one task should ONLY analyze talent, another ONLY cost of living, etc.
- For comparison queries (e.g., "compare X and Y"), create tasks that each focus on a single item (e.g., "analyze X" and "analyze Y") rather than each doing a comparison
- Don't use [INJECTION_POINT] markers - each task prompt should be complete and standalone
- Task prompts should be specific and detailed enough to get comprehensive information about that subject
- Task prompts should request information that will be useful for later comparison or synthesis
- Avoid redundancy between tasks, but ensure complete coverage of the query
- For complex subjects, you can create multiple tasks that cover different aspects of the same subject
- NEVER use placeholder references like "City A," "Company B," or "Technology X" - always use specific, real-world examples
- Always provide concrete, real-world examples when discussing cities (e.g., "Austin," "Seattle," "New York"), companies (e.g., "Google," "Microsoft," "Apple"), or technologies

USER QUERY:
{user_query}
"""

# Synthesis prompt for combining results into a final response
SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """# Synthesis Prompt

## Purpose
You are a synthesis expert tasked with combining the results from multiple parallel research tasks into a cohesive, integrated response that directly answers the user's original query. Your primary goal is to provide a clear, definitive answer or recommendation based on the evidence, not just present various options.

## Instructions

1. Review the original user query carefully to understand their exact information needs.

2. Read through each of the specialized task results, identifying key insights, complementary information, contrasting perspectives, and unique contributions from each.

3. IMPORTANT: You MUST do more than just summarize or regurgitate the individual task results. You must:
   - Identify patterns, themes, and relationships across different task results
   - Draw novel connections that weren't explicit in any individual result
   - Resolve contradictions between different task results when they exist
   - Prioritize information based on relevance to the user's query, not just repeat everything
   - Provide a deeper level of insight by combining perspectives from different tasks
   - Add value by making observations about how different aspects interact

4. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: You MUST provide a clear, definitive answer or recommendation. If the query asks for a decision, comparison, or recommendation (like "which city is best" or "which technology should I use"), you MUST take a stance and provide a specific recommendation with supporting evidence, not just list pros and cons of each option.

5. Create a comprehensive, integrated response that:
   - Begins with a direct, clear answer to the query in the first paragraph
   - If appropriate, starts with a one-sentence summary of your recommendation or conclusion
   - Combines insights from all task results into a unified analysis
   - Presents information in a structured, logical flow that builds toward key conclusions
   - Eliminates redundancies while preserving important details
   - Highlights points of agreement and disagreement between different task results
   - Provides factual, detailed examples rather than hypothetical or abstract ones
   - Ends with a clear reinforcement of your main recommendation or conclusion

6. Your response should be cohesive and read as if it came from a single expert who deeply researched all aspects of the question, not as just a summary of the individual task results.

## Format
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any introduction like "Here is my response" or "After analyzing the information" - just start directly with the answer
- Format your response with proper Markdown:
  - Use # for main headings (e.g., # Main Topic)
  - Use ## for subheadings (e.g., ## Subtopic)
  - Use bullet points with - or * for lists
  - Use **bold** for emphasis
  - Use `code blocks` for code or technical terms
  - Use > for quotes or important points
- Include all relevant information from the task results without unnecessary repetition
- Always use section headings to organize information
- Do not mention that the response was created from multiple task results or reference the synthesis process itself

## Concrete Examples Requirement
- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Always use concrete, real-world examples and NEVER use hypothetical placeholders
- Never use abstract references like "Company A," "City B," or "Technology X" 
- Always refer to actual companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Apple), cities (e.g., Austin, Seattle, New York), or technologies by their real names
- When discussing examples, be specific about real locations, organizations, technologies, and facts
- If the task results mention hypothetical examples, replace them with real, concrete examples in your synthesis

## Decision Making Framework
For queries requiring a decision or recommendation:
1. Start with your conclusive recommendation in the first paragraph
2. Present the key evidence supporting your recommendation
3. Acknowledge trade-offs or second-best alternatives
4. Do NOT present a list of options without taking a clear stance
5. If the best option depends on specific variables, clearly state the conditional logic (e.g., "Austin is best if remote work flexibility is your priority, while Seattle is optimal if you need in-person access to major tech companies")
6. Reinforce your recommendation in the conclusion
7. For technology selection tasks: ONLY after making a clear technology choice should you address implementation details like directory structure, architecture, or configuration. These details should be specific to the selected technology, not generic or applicable to multiple options.

## Methods of True Synthesis (You MUST apply these)
1. **Cross-Referencing**: Find where information from different tasks intersects and provide deeper analysis on those points.
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify what's missing across all the task results and acknowledge these gaps.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes or contradictions across different results.
4. **Framework Development**: Create an original analytical framework that organizes insights from all tasks.
5. **Implications & Applications**: Discuss broader implications that weren't explicit in any single task result.
6. **Priority Determination**: Make judgments about which findings are most important/relevant to the query.
7. **Decision Making**: Provide clear, specific recommendations rather than just listing options or pros/cons.

## Final Check
Before submitting your response, verify that:
1. Your answer starts directly with a clear, definitive answer or recommendation
2. All information is presented in proper Markdown format
3. You've used real-world entities and examples throughout
4. All placeholders like "City A" have been replaced with real examples
5. You've gone beyond mere summarization and created a true synthesis with novel connections and insights
6. You've added value beyond what was explicitly stated in the individual task results
7. CRITICAL: You've provided a clear recommendation or decision, not just information about various options

Provide your response below:
"""

# Evaluation prompt for assessing if solutions are ready for synthesis
SOLUTION_EVALUATION_PROMPT = """# Solution Evaluation Prompt

## Purpose
You are an expert evaluator tasked with determining whether the current set of parallel task results contains sufficient information to answer the user's original query. Your job is to decide if we should proceed to synthesis or if we need additional exploration of promising paths.

## Instructions

1. Review the original user query carefully to understand exactly what the user is asking.

2. Read through each of the task results, identifying:
   - What approaches were tried
   - Whether any approach led to a clear, conclusive answer
   - Whether the results collectively provide enough information to answer the query

3. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Default to synthesis whenever possible. Only recommend additional exploration if absolutely necessary. In most cases, the existing results contain enough information to formulate a good response.

4. Make a determination about whether these results are ready for synthesis:
   - If at least one result provides a useful answer → Ready for synthesis
   - If the results collectively allow for a reasonable answer → Ready for synthesis 
   - If the results contain enough information to address the core question → Ready for synthesis
   - If all approaches failed completely → Ready for synthesis (acknowledge limitations)
   - ONLY if results provide completely contradictory information on critical points → Not ready

5. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: For technology selection and similar decision tasks:
   - If you have information about each option → Ready for synthesis
   - If you can make ANY kind of recommendation → Ready for synthesis
   - Only suggest further exploration if completely unable to distinguish between options

6. If not ready for synthesis (which should be rare), identify 1-2 promising paths for deeper exploration.
   - Be specific about which approaches showed potential and why
   - Focus only on critical information gaps that prevent answering the query
   - Stay laser-focused on the original query - don't suggest tangential explorations

## Output Format
READY_FOR_SYNTHESIS: [true/false]

EXPLANATION:
[Detailed explanation of your evaluation, including what was learned, what approaches succeeded or failed, and why you believe the results are ready or not ready for synthesis.]

PROMISING_PATHS:
[If not ready for synthesis, list 1-3 specific promising approaches or modifications that should be explored further. Number each path. If ready for synthesis, this section can be omitted.]

## Example 1: Ready for Synthesis
READY_FOR_SYNTHESIS: true

EXPLANATION:
The task results include a comprehensive proof using mathematical induction that conclusively proves the theorem. While other approaches were attempted (direct algebraic manipulation and numerical verification), the induction method provided a complete, correct proof. The results collectively answer the query definitively, and no further exploration is needed.

## Example 2: Not Ready for Synthesis
READY_FOR_SYNTHESIS: false

EXPLANATION:
None of the current approaches have yielded a full solution to the differential equation. However, both the separation of variables method and the integrating factor method showed partial success. The separation of variables approach correctly identified the general structure but encountered difficulties with a specific integral. The integrating factor method made good progress but was hindered by an error in handling the non-homogeneous term.

PROMISING_PATHS:
1. Refine the separation of variables approach by using partial fractions to resolve the troublesome integral. This approach got furthest and appears to be the most promising.
2. Correct the integrating factor calculation by properly accounting for the product rule when differentiating the product of the integrating factor and the original function.
3. Attempt a power series solution, which might be more suitable given the form of the differential equation.

## Example 3: Not Ready for Selection Synthesis
READY_FOR_SYNTHESIS: false

EXPLANATION:
The task results contain good information about each tech stack individually, but we're missing a clear comparative analysis to make a proper selection. While we have criteria established, we need to apply these criteria to both frameworks and reach a decision before proceeding to details like directory structure. The current results provide good foundational information but need additional analysis before we can make a well-justified technology choice.

PROMISING_PATHS:
1. Directly compare NextJS with FastAPI and Phoenix LiveView using the selection criteria identified, with explicit scoring or evaluation of each framework against each criterion.
2. Analyze real-world use cases of AI chat applications built with each framework to gather empirical evidence of their performance in this specific domain.
3. Consider project-specific constraints (team expertise, time constraints, specific requirements) to contextualize the framework selection before attempting to define implementation details.

## Purpose
You are a strategic problem solver tasked with generating a new set of parallel subtasks that focus on the most promising paths identified from previous results. Your goal is to explore these promising approaches in greater depth to reach a conclusive answer to the user's original query.

## Instructions

1. Review the original user query to understand the core problem.

2. Review the previous task results to understand what approaches have been tried and what was learned.

3. Focus particularly on the identified promising paths that deserve deeper exploration.

4. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Stay laser-focused on the original user query. Do not create tasks that:
   - Explore tangential topics not directly related to answering the original question
   - Ask for general "feedback" or "insights" without specific direction
   - Add new requirements or dimensions not present in the original query
   - Shift the focus to adjacent problems or solutions

5. Create 2-4 specific subtasks that will explore these promising paths in greater depth.
   - Each subtask should focus on a single, specialized approach or angle
   - Subtasks should be distinct but complementary
   - Prioritize paths that showed partial success or promising insights
   - Include specific guidance based on lessons learned from previous attempts
   - Ensure every subtask directly contributes to answering the specific question asked

6. For each subtask:
   - Provide a clear, specific subject that describes the approach
   - Create a detailed prompt that guides the exploration of this particular approach
   - Include any relevant context from previous results
   - Specify what specifically to focus on and what to avoid based on previous attempts
   - Ensure the prompt is tightly scoped to the exact original question

7. Structure your output exactly like the decomposition prompt format (see below).

SYNTHESIS_RECOMMENDATION: true

## Example 1: Mathematical Proof
For a mathematical proof:

DECOMPOSITION_SUMMARY:
Focusing on the two most promising proof strategies that showed partial success in previous attempts, with refinements to address previous limitations.

PARALLEL_TASKS_COUNT: 3

TASK_1_SUBJECT: Refined Induction Proof
TASK_1_PROMPT: Develop a complete proof by mathematical induction for the theorem. Building on the previous attempt, pay special attention to the inductive step where the previous approach encountered difficulties with the binomial expansion. Specifically, use the binomial theorem to expand (k+1)^n, gather like terms, and apply the inductive hypothesis precisely. Show each step in detail.

TASK_2_SUBJECT: Direct Algebraic Proof
TASK_2_PROMPT: Construct a direct algebraic proof using the approach of expressing the sum in closed form. The previous attempt made progress with the algebraic manipulation but encountered difficulties when handling the summation property. Use the technique of partial fractions specifically, and pay careful attention to the boundary conditions at i=1 and i=n.

TASK_3_SUBJECT: Combinatorial Proof
TASK_3_PROMPT: Develop a combinatorial proof by identifying what is being counted on both sides of the equation. Previous approaches didn't consider this angle. Show how the left side and right side count the same objects in different ways. Consider using concepts from combinatorial analysis such as binomial coefficients and their properties to establish the equivalence.

## Example 2: Technology Selection
For technology stack selection:

DECOMPOSITION_SUMMARY:
Focusing on making a clear framework selection by directly comparing the two options against established criteria before addressing implementation details.

PARALLEL_TASKS_COUNT: 3

TASK_1_SUBJECT: Framework Comparison Analysis
TASK_1_PROMPT: Perform a detailed side-by-side comparison of NextJS with FastAPI versus Phoenix LiveView specifically for AI chat applications. Use the criteria established in the previous analysis (real-time capabilities, resource consumption, learning curve, maintainability, and streaming support). For each criterion, provide a direct comparison with specific examples and assign a relative score or rating to each framework. Conclude with a clear recommendation of which framework is superior for this specific use case. Do NOT include directory structure or implementation details at this stage.

TASK_2_SUBJECT: Real-world AI Chat Implementation Analysis
TASK_2_PROMPT: Research and analyze real-world examples of AI chat applications built with both NextJS/FastAPI and Phoenix LiveView. Focus on case studies, benchmarks, and developer testimonials that provide empirical evidence of how these frameworks perform in production for similar applications. Identify any recurring patterns, challenges, or success stories. Conclude with observations about which framework has demonstrated better results specifically for AI chat applications. Do NOT include directory structure or implementation details.

TASK_3_SUBJECT: Project-Specific Constraints Analysis
TASK_3_PROMPT: Analyze how project-specific constraints might influence the framework selection for an AI chat application. Consider factors such as: development team experience, timeline constraints, scaling requirements, deployment environment, and integration needs. For each constraint type, discuss how it would affect the choice between NextJS/FastAPI and Phoenix LiveView. Conclude with a recommendation of which framework is likely better suited when considering these practical constraints. Do NOT include directory structure or implementation details.
